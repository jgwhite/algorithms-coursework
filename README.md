# Algorithms Course

Just a little scratchpad for working through the
[Stanford Algorithms Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo)
available for free on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/).

Itâ€™s also an excuse to write some C for the first time since university.

Expect some very dopey code :)
